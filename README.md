Combining a servo motor with an ultrasonic sensor is a great way to create interactive projects! For example, you can use the ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and then move the servo motor based on that distance.

Components Needed
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
Servo motor (e.g., SG90)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Wiring the Components
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:

VCC to 5V on Arduino
GND to GND on Arduino
Trig to digital pin (e.g., Pin 9)
Echo to digital pin (e.g., Pin 10)
Servo Motor:

Red wire (VCC) to 5V on Arduino
Brown/Black wire (GND) to GND on Arduino
Yellow/White wire (Signal) to digital pin (e.g., Pin 11)
Example Code
Hereâ€™s a sample code that reads the distance from the ultrasonic sensor and moves the servo based on that distance.

cpp
Copy code
#include <Servo.h>

const int trigPin = 9; // Trigger pin for ultrasonic sensor
const int echoPin = 10; // Echo pin for ultrasonic sensor
const int servoPin = 11; // Pin for servo motor

Servo myServo; // Create a Servo object

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication
  myServo.attach(servoPin); // Attach the servo to pin 11
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); // Set trigger pin as output
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT); // Set echo pin as input
}

void loop() {
  // Clear the trigPin
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  
  // Set the trigPin HIGH for 10 microseconds
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  
  // Read the echoPin, returns the sound wave travel time in microseconds
  long duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  
  // Calculate the distance in cm
  long distance = duration * 0.034 / 2; // Speed of sound is 0.034 cm/us
  
  // Print the distance to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");
  
  // Map distance to servo position
  int servoPosition = map(distance, 0, 100, 0, 180); // Adjust the range as needed
  servoPosition = constrain(servoPosition, 0, 180); // Ensure position is between 0 and 180

  myServo.write(servoPosition); // Move the servo to the mapped position
  delay(500); // Wait before the next reading
}
Explanation of the Code
Library Inclusion: The Servo.h library is included to control the servo motor.
Pin Setup: The ultrasonic sensor and servo motor pins are defined.
Setup Function: Initializes serial communication, attaches the servo, and sets pin modes.
Loop Function:
Triggers the ultrasonic sensor to measure distance.
Reads the echo time and calculates the distance.
Maps the distance to a servo position (0-180 degrees).
Constrains the servo position to ensure it stays within valid limits.
Moves the servo to the mapped position.
Testing
Upload the code to your Arduino.
Open the Serial Monitor to see the distance readings.
The servo should move based on the distance detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
Adjustments
You can adjust the mapping range in the map() function depending on your specific project needs.
Experiment with different distances and servo movements to create interesting behaviors!

Explanation
Power: Ensure both the ultrasonic sensor and the servo motor are powered from the Arduino's 5V and GND pins.
Signal Connections: The Trig and Echo pins of the ultrasonic sensor are connected to digital pins 9 and 10 on the Arduino. The signal pin of the servo motor is connected to digital pin 11.
Notes
If your servo motor requires more power than the Arduino can provide, consider using an external power source for the servo.
Make sure to connect all grounds (Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and servo) together to ensure a common reference point.
If you need a more detailed or graphical diagram, there are many online circuit design tools, such as Fritzing, that can help visualize this setup. Let me know if you need anything else!
